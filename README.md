# OpenIntro Statistics Labs, in R

This repo contains my work to complete the labs for the book [OpenIntro Statistics](https://www.openintro.org/stat/). Anyone is welcome to use this work for their learning (and other purposes?) as long as they adhere to OpenIntro's license (see below).

This repository contains my answers to lab questions, and I do not guarantee that they are correct. If you see a mistake, please feel free to open an issue.

## Ownership/License
Some questions were copied verbatim from the OpenIntro Statistics labs (I used markdown quoting to indicate this).

The data, including data files in each lab directory, belongs to OpenIntro Statistics. I copied it here for posterity (in case the labs change). Their resources were released under the [creative commons 3.0 share-alike license](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/) and so is this work.
