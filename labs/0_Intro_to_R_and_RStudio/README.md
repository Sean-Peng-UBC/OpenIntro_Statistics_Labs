# Lab 0: Intro to R and RStudio

## Some Exploration
I did not save any work for this section.

## On Your Own
Files:
  - present.R - the instructions said to `source("http://www.openintro.org/stat/data/present.R")`. I
  downloaded present.R with `wget http://www.openintro.org/stat/data/present.R` and saved it in this
  folder.
  - arbuthnot.R - the arbuthnot dataset
  - solutions.R - my solutions to the questions asked in the lab.
